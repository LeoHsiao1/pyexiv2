# pyexiv2

Read and write image metadata, including [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif), [IPTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Press_Telecommunications_Council), [XMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform), [ICC Profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile).
- Install: `pip install pyexiv2`
- [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/LeoHsiao1/pyexiv2)
- [Tutorial](https://github.com/LeoHsiao1/pyexiv2/blob/master/docs/Tutorial.md) | [中文教程](https://github.com/LeoHsiao1/pyexiv2/blob/master/docs/Tutorial-cn.md)

## Features

- Base on C++ API of [Exiv2](https://exiv2.org/index.html) and wrapped with [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).
- Supports running on 64bit Linux, MacOS and Windows, with CPython(≥3.6) interpreter.
- [Supports various image metadata](https://exiv2.org/metadata.html)
- [Supports various image formats](https://exiv2.org/manpage.html#file_types)
- Supports opening images based on the file path or from bytes data.
- Supports Unicode characters that contained in image path or metadata.

## Defects

- Can't read the image larger than 2GB, or modify the image larger than 1GB. ([related issue](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/1248))
- Not thread safe, because pyexiv2 uses some global variables in C++.

## Tests

There are some test cases in folder [pyexiv2/tests](https://github.com/LeoHsiao1/pyexiv2/blob/master/pyexiv2/tests/).
